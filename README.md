#pyLoginItems - Manipulating user login items in OS X using the built-in python 

pyLoginItems is a module that can be used to list, add, or remove login items (System Preferences -> Users and Groups -> select an account -> Login Items) from a user account, but must be run within the user's login session and permissions to do it (i.e. as a login script, user launchd item, etc.)

Basic example usage is included in the comments within the file.
